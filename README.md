# Convo - The Social App You Wish Existed

A **text-based social platform** where people connect through real-time conversations on topics they're passionate about.

---

## 🎯 What is Convo?

Convo combines the best of **Discord** and **Twitter (X)** — browse through topics, tap on what interests you, and jump into live chat rooms with like-minded people. It's social media built around meaningful conversations, not endless scrolling.

**Think**: Discord's real-time chat + Twitter's topic discovery = Convo

- **TypeScript** – Type-safe development across the entire codebase
- **Supabase** – Backend and database (migrated from Firebase for better relational data handling)

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why Supabase over Firebase?

Initially built with Firebase, we migrated to Supabase because:
- **Relational Database**: Social media apps require complex relationships between users, messages, topics, and rooms
- **Better SQL Support**: More efficient queries for social graph operations
- **Scalability**: Superior performance for real-time social features
- **Developer Experience**: Easier to manage complex data structures
