# Convo - The Social App You Wish Existed

# What is Convo?
Convo is a text-based social platform where people have conversations based on topics they're interested in.
Think of convo as Discord + Twitter(Now X), where there're a list of topics you can scroll through, and when you click on a topic, you go into a chat room, where you chat in real time with other people.
